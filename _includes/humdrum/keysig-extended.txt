### Key signature cancellation ###

When changing to a new key signature, there are two styles: either with cancellation
of accidentals in the previous key signature when necessary, or by just displaying the
new key signature without cancellations, which is more typical of modern notation.

Regardless of which style, when moving to a key signature which has no sharps or flats, cancellation
accidentals are required, otherwise the new key siganture is not visible in the music notation:

{% include verovio.html
	humdrum-min-height="350px"
	source="cancelnatural"
	scale="40"
	pageWidth="1300"
%}
<script type="application/x-humdrum" id="cancelnatural">
**kern
*I"
*clefG2
*k[f#c#g#]
*M4/4
=1
1a
=2||
*k[]
1cc
=3||
*k[b-e-a-d-]
1a-
=4||
*k[]
1cc
==
*-
</script>

By default, cancellation signatures will not be used when switching between key signatures
that contain accidentals:

{% include verovio.html
	humdrum-min-height="350px"
	source="nocancel"
	scale="40"
	pageWidth="1300"
%}
<script type="application/x-humdrum" id="nocancel">
**kern
*I"
*clefG2
*k[f#c#g#]
*M4/4
=1
1a
=2||
*k[b-e-a-]
1cc
=3||
*k[f#c#g#d#a#]
1b
=4||
*k[f#]
1g
==
*-
</script>

By adding `*kcancel` to a `**kern` spine, cancellation accidentals will be added to the key signatures
that follow in the spine:

{% include verovio.html
	humdrum-min-height="355px"
	source="cancel"
	scale="40"
	pageWidth="1300"
%}
<script type="application/x-humdrum" id="cancel">
**kern
*I"
*clefG2
*kcancel
*k[f#c#g#]
*M4/4
=1
1a
=2||
*k[b-e-a-]
1cc
=3||
*k[f#c#g#d#a#]
1b
=4||
*k[f#]
1g
==
*-
</script>

Adding the tandem interpretation `*Xkcancel` will revert to the default style of no cancellations:

{% include verovio.html
	humdrum-min-height="375px"
	source="semicancel"
	scale="40"
	pageWidth="1300"
%}
<script type="application/x-humdrum" id="semicancel">
**kern
*I"
*clefG2
*kcancel
*k[f#c#g#]
*M4/4
=1
1a
=2||
*k[b-e-a-]
1cc
=3||
*k[f#c#g#d#a#]
*Xkcancel
1b
=4||
*k[f#]
1g
==
*-
</script>
