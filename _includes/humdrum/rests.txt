## Rests ##

Rests are represent by the character `r` in `**kern` data.
Whole-measure rests are given their actual duration, and if the
duration of the rest matches the time signature, then the rest will
be displayed as a centered whole-measure rest regardless of its actual
duration (or as a breve-measure rest if the duration of the measure
is a breve or longer).
