## Clefs ##

VHV will automatically choose the most suitable clef (either bass
or treble) to fit the pitch range of the notes on a staff, but
typically a clef is encoded explicitly for the music.  Clefs are
encoded in *interpretation tokens* that start with a single `*`
followed by the string `clef` and then the shape and line position
of the clef.  For example, a treble clef is `*clefG2`, with `G`
meaning a G-clef, and `2` meaning that the clef is centered on the
second line up from the bottom of the staff.  The bass clef is
`*clefF4` since it is an F-clef on the fourth line of the staff.

Try moving the clefs to different staff lines by changing the number 
after the clef shape in the above example textbox.

A vocal tenor clef is represented by `*clefGv2`, where the `v` means
the music should be played an octave lower than the regular clef's
sounding pitches.  Try creating a vocal tenor clef in the above
interactive example. The `v` operator also works on the other clefs
(but these sorts of clefs are very rare).  Another rare clef is
`*clefG^2` which is the opposite of `*clefGv2`, where the music is
written an octave lower than actually sounding pitch for the normal
form of the clef.  You can also try to create exotic two-octave
clefs by doubling the `^^` and `vv` markers.
