## Key signatures ##

Key signatures are represented by interpretations in the form `*k[X]`, where `X`
is a list of the accidentals in the order in which they are displayed in the
key signature.  Here a scale in C-sharp major and C-flat major, showing all of the
accidentals in their proper order:

### Key designation ###

The *key* of the music is different from the *key signature*.
Indicate the key of the music by adding an interpretation in this
form `*X:`, where `X` is a pitch name plus possible accidental,
with lower-case pitch names indicating minor keys, and upper-case
pitch names indicating major keys.  For example, `*C:` means C
major, and `*a:` means A minor (note that both have the key signature
`*k[]` where there are no sharps or flats).

The key designation typical follows the key signature, or can appear
on its own if the key changes but the key signature does not.

{% include verovio.html
	humdrum-min-height="450px"
	source="key2"
	scale="55"
	pageWidth="500"
%}
<script type="application/x-humdrum" id="key2">
**kern

Note that the music in the last measure does not have a key signature change
even though the music modulates to C-sharp minor.

### Modal key designations ###

The following codes can be appended to the key designation to indicate a 
particular mode:


|  code  | meaning     | example
| ------ | ----------- | ---------
| `dor`  | dorian      | `*d:dor`
| `phr`  | phrygian    | `*e:phr`
| `lyd`  | lydian      | `*F:lyd`
| `mix`  | mixolydian  | `*G:mix`
| `aeo`  | aeolian     | `*a:aeo`
| `ion`  | ionian      | `*C:ion`
| `loc`  | locrian     | `*b:loc`


If the mode is closest to a minor key, then a lower-case letter will be used for the tonic note;
otherwise, modes closer to major use an upper-case for the tonic.
