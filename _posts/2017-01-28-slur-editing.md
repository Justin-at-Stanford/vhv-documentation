Slurs can now be edited graphically in the notation editor window.
Slurs are added by clicking on a note and then typing
<span class="keypress">s</span> to add a slur to the next note.
Typing a number between <span class="keypress">2</span> and 
<span class="keypress">9</span> before
<span class="keypress">s</span> will add a longer slur.
Slurs can also be moved in the graphic notation after they are created.

See the documentation about [graphical slurs](/graphical/slurs) for more
information.
