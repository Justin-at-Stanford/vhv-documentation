A <a href="/interface/toolbar">toolbar</a> has been added in the
top left corner of the VHV website.  This toolbar contains useful
actions for quick access.  There are several toolbars that can be
cycled through, including toolbars for loading and saving to
temporary buffers, musical searching, and data filtering.
