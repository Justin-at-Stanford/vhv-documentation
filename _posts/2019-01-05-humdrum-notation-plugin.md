After editing your music in VHV, you can display
the notation dynamically on your webpage with the
[Humdrum notation plugin](http://plugin.humdrum.org).  The
[topics](https://plugin.humdrum.org/topic) page of the plugin documentation
gives demonstrations of how to configure and use the plugin, such as [saving SVG
images](https://plugin.humdrum.org/topic/saving) and [viewing notation
from a list of pieces](https://plugin.humdrum.org/topic/toggle).
