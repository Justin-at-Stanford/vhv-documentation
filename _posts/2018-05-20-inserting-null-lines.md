Three convenience comands have been added to the VHV interface:
[<span class='keypress'>alt-shift-l</span>](/commands/alt-shift-l),
[<span class='keypress'>alt-shift-i</span>](/commands/alt-shift-i), and
[<span class='keypress'>alt-shift-d</span>](/commands/alt-shift-d).
These commands will add an empty local comment, interpretation, or data line
respectively above the current line in the text editor.  This speeds up
entry of layout commands, clef changes, or similar sorts of action requiring
a new spined line to be added to the score.
