A system for embedding Humdrum 
<a href="/interface/musicxml/#embedding-tandem-interpretations">interpretations</a>, 
<a href="/interface/musicxml/#embedding-local-comments">comments</a> and 
<a href="/interface/musicxml/#embedding-reference-records">reference records</a>
has been added to the MusicXML-to-Humdrum converter.  This allows for most extra 
Humdrum markup to be added within a graphical music editor before converting
MusicXML data into Humdrum in VHV.
