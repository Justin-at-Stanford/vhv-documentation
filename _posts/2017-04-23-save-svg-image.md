Documentation for the <span class="keypress">alt-g</span> command 
[has been added](/commands/alt-g).  SVG images of the displayed music
notation can be extracted from the page and then saved by pasting into a 
text editor.  The documentation also discusses how to generate bitmap images
using GIMP as well as editing the image in Inkscape as a vector-graphics 
image.
