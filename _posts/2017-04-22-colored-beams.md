[Here](myvhv/svg_notes/colored_beams.html) is an example implementation
of coloring SVG output notation from verovio.  Diatonic pitch-classes 
are given different colors, and other graphical markup such as stems, ties,
and beams are colored by pitch-class as well, using a mixture of CSS and javascript.
You can edit the music in the text box on the demo page to change the 
colored music notation dynamically.  Also try copy/pasting other 
Humdrum data into the text box. 

Also see the [simpler coloring method](/myvhv/svg_notes/colored_notes.html),
which only uses CSS.
