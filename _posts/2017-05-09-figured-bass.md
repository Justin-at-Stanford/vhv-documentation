An initial implementation of figured bass has been created
for the Humdrum to MEI converter.  A live example can
be seen [here](/humdrum/figured_bass).  Rodolfo Zitellini 
recently implemented rendering of figured bass in verovio,
and he will be presenting his work on it at the 
[Music Encoding Conference](http://music-encoding.org/community/conference)
next week in Tours, France.
