An initial implementation of `**mens` for encoding white mensural notation
has been added to [humlib](https://humlib.sapp.org) and [VHV](http://verovio.humdrum.org).
See the `**mens` [documentation page](/humdrum/mens) for a description of the representation,
as well as the [kern2mens filter](/filters/kern2mens) for documentation on how to
convert modern notation into `**mens` data.
