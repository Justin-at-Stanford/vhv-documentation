Beams can now be split in the notation editor.  Typing <span
class="keypress">L</span> while selecting a note/chord/rest within
a beam will split the beam before the selection.  Typing <span
class="keypress">J</span> while selecting a note/chord/rest within a beam
will split the beam after the selection.  [More info...](/graphic/beams)
