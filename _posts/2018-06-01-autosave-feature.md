An autosave feature has been implemented for
[VHV](http://verovio.humdrum.org).  When you leave the VHV website,
either accidentally or on purpose, the contents of the text editor
will be saved.  If you return to the editor within an hour, the previous
contents of the editor will be restored automatically.  If you do not want
the old contents loaded, add the `k=e` parameter to the URL, such as
[http://verovio.humdrum.org?k=e](http://verovio.humdrum.org?k=e), which will
erase the autosaved contents.
