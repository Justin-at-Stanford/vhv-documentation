A <a href="/filter/sic">sic system</a> for marking obvious errors in 
a source edition has been implemented.  This system can manage whether
the original or a corrected reading of the score is displayed in the
digital score.  In addition, a verbose marker can be used to
display a green triangle above sic notes in the rendering of the
digital score.
