A brief list of commands and other resources can be displayed within the [VHV
interface](http://verovio.humdrum.org) by clicking on the <span class="question">?</span> icon at
the top of the page, or by pressing the <kbd>?</kbd> key.  If you are currently editing text
in the text edtior, instead use <kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>?</kbd> to avoid typing a question mark in the editor.

	alt="VHV main page"
	caption="Red arrow points to the help icon."
%}

After clicking on the help icon, the help menu appears:

{% include image.html
	file="helpmenu.png"
	alt="VHV main page showing help menu"
	caption="Verovio Humdrum Viewer with the help menu displayed"
%}

The help menu is longer than the height of the window, but you can
scroll through it to see all of its contents:


{% include image.html
	file="helpmenu-scroll.gif"
	alt="Scrolling through the help menu"
	caption="Scrolling through the help menu"
%}


Pressing the <span class="question">?</span> icon at the top of the page again, or typing <kbd>?</kbd> will
hide the help menu.  If the browser page is wide, you can keep the
help menu open for quick reference while you using the interface.
