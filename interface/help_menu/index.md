## Opening and closing the help menu ##

A brief list of commands and other resources can be displayed within the [VHV
interface](http://verovio.humdrum.org) by clicking on the <span class="question">?</span> icon at
the top of the page, or by pressing the <kbd>?</kbd> key.  If you are currently editing text
in the text editor, instead use <kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>?</kbd> to avoid typing a question mark in the editor.

After clicking on the help icon, the help menu appears:

	alt="VHV main page showing help menu"
	caption="Verovio Humdrum Viewer with the help menu displayed"
%}

The help menu is longer than the height of the window, but you can
scroll through it to see all of its contents:

	caption="Scrolling through the help menu"
%}


Pressing the <span class="question">?</span> icon at the top of the page again, or typing <kbd>?</kbd> will
hide the help menu.  If the browser page is wide, you can keep the
help menu open for quick reference while you using the interface.

## Tandem display of VHV documentation ##

At the top of the help menu is a link to this documentation website.  If you want to have quick reference
to the documentation while you are using VHV.  This will open the documentation in another tab.  You can
move this tab to its own window and resize according to the available space on your desktop.  

Help menu items highlighted in red are hyperlinks into the documentation, and will open up in
documentation window as demonstrated below.
