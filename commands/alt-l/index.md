Pressing <span class="keypress">alt-l</span> will toggle colorization
of secondary layers in the notation.  This feature can be useful
for proof-reading music by highlighting unusual sub-spine/layer
organization in the data that is not visible in the graphical
notation, such as interchanged layers (cases where layers 1 and 2 should
be interchanged).

Here is an animated demonstration of pressing <span class="keypress">alt-l</span>
several times in some real music:
