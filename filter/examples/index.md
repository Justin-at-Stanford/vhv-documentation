apply to a sample piece of music.


## Transposition ##

The [transposition](/filter/transposition) filter can be used to transpose
the score in various ways that are illustrated below.

<div data-category="transposition"></div>



## Compound filters ##

Here are examples of how to mix multiple filters together.  Each filter 
is separated from the next with a pipe character (|).

<div data-category="pipeline"></div>


## Musical excerpts ##

The [myank](/filter/myank) filter can be used to extract musical examples
from longer scores.


<div data-category="excerpt"></div>



## Part extraction ##

The [extract](/filter/extract) filter can be used to extract parts
and other data spines from a full score.


<div data-category="extract"></div>




## Chords ##

The [chord](/filter/chord) filter can be used to manipulate chords.


<div data-category="chord"></div>



## Searching ##

The [msearch](/filter/chord) filter (meaning *music search*) can be used to search for
musical patterns.
