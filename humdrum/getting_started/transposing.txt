## Transposing parts ##

Transposing scores are always encoded in sounding pitch in Humdrum
data, and instructions for transposing to written pitch are encoded
at the start of the part.  In the following example, the second
spine encodes a B-flat clarinet part, with the transposition
interpretation `*ITrd1c2` meaning that the written part is a diatonic
step up, equivalent to 2 semi-tone up.
