## Pitch ##

Here is a short music example of notes, each containing a rhythm
and then a pitch:

{% include verovio.html
	source="pitch1"
	scale="55"
	pageWidth="1400"
	humdrum-min-height="170px"
%}
<script type="application/x-humdrum" id="pitch1">
**kern
4c
4d
4e
4f
*-
</script>

`4` represents a quarter note, and `c`, `d`, `e` and `f` represent
the first four pitches of the fourth octave (middle-C octave).  The
musical example is interactive and changes whenever you type
text into the box to the left, so try adding pitches for G, A and B
in the same octave to the notation like this:  

{% include verovio.html
	humdrum-visible="false"
	source="pitch2"
	scale="55"
	pageWidth="1400"
%}
<script type="application/x-humdrum" id="pitch2">
**kern
4c
4d
4e
4f
4g
4a
4b
*-
</script>


Experiment with the numbers to generate other
rhythms, such as half notes and eighth notes:

{% include verovio.html
	humdrum-visible="false"
	source="pitch3"
	scale="55"
	pageWidth="1400"
%}
<script type="application/x-humdrum" id="pitch3">
**kern
8c
2d
8e
8f
4g
4a
2b
*-
</script>

Note the order of rhythm and then pitch in the encoded notes.  The
order can be reversed, although the canonical order is rhythm first,
then pitch.  Try reversing the order of a note such as `4c` to `c4`
and see what happens to the note in the graphical notation.
