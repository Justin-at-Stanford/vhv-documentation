## Tuplets ##

Tuplets are no different from regular rhythmic values since they
describe how many notes of that duration sum together to create a 
whole-note duration.  Triplet eighth notes are represented with
the number `12` because twelve of them equal a whole-note duration.
quintuplet sixteenth notes are represented as `20` since 20 of the
equal a whole-note duration.

### Extended Rhythm representation ###

Note durations that do not divide the duration of a whole note into an integer 
number of equal pieces (when also accounting for augmentation dots), must be encoded in an 
extended `**recip` representation.  This system is understood by VHV and
[Humdrum Extras](http://extras.humdrum.org), but not in the classical
Humdrum Toolkit (see [rscale](http://extras.humdrum.org/man/rscale) for
using extended rhythms with the Humdrum Toolkit).

Example extended rhythms include triplet whole notes.  3/2 of a
triplet whole note fill the duration of a regular whole note, so
it is represented by the string `3%2`.  Another way of conceptualizing
this is to flip the numbers in the rhythm string, noting that a triplet
whole note is 2/3rds of a whole note:

{% include verovio.html
	humdrum-min-height="275px"
	evenNoteSpacing="1"
	source="ext1"
	scale="55"
	pageWidth="1000"
%}
<script type="application/x-humdrum" id="ext1">
**kern
*M2/1

3%2e
3%2f
=2
3%2.g
3f
3%2d
=3
1%2e

</script>

Notice the `1%2` rhythm in the last measure.  This represent a
double whole note, since 1/2 of the double whole note is equivalent
to a whole note.  `0` is a special code equivalent to `1%2`, `00` is equivalent
to `1%4` (a long) and `000` is equivalent to `1%8` (a maxima).  It
is probably best to use the zero-system for breves, maximas and
longs, reserving extended rhythms for readability and use 
`%`-based descriptions more complicated rhythmic cases.
