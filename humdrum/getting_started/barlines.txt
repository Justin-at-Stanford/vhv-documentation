## Barlines ##

Barlines are indicated by a *token* starting with an equals sign.  A optional 
number can immediately follow the equals sign, representing a measure number.
VHV will display the bar number at each system break, excluding a label for 
measure&nbsp;1:

{% include verovio.html
	humdrum-min-height="525px"
	source="bar1"
	scale="55"
	pageWidth="1000"
%}
<script type="application/x-humdrum" id="bar1">
**kern
*clefG2
=1
1c

1d

1e

1f

1a

1b
=8
1cc
=9
1dd
=10
1ee
=11
1ff
=12
1gg
=
*-
</script>


Following the measure number can be an optional styling for the barline. `-` means an
invisible barline, `||` is a double thin barline, `|!:` is a left-repeat, 
`:|!|:` is a left-right repeat.  A special style is `==`, representing a final
barline.  This bar usually does not include a bar number, since it is the last
one in the piece/movement.

{% include verovio.html
	source="bar2"
	scale="55"
	pageWidth="900"
%}
<script type="application/x-humdrum" id="bar2">
**kern
*clefG2

=3||
1e
=4
1f
=5!|:
1g
=6:|!|:

=7:|!

*-
</script>


Humdrum can represent more barline styles, but the above types are currently
supported in verovio.


### Pick-up measures ###

Typically the initial barline should be labeled in the Humdrum encoding 
even though it is not printed.  Either `=1` or `=1-` should be used at the
start of the first measure (with `-` meaning an invisible barline).  Labeling
the first bar is necessary if you need to extract it by measure number with
a tool such as [myank](/filters/myank).

Pickup beats do not have a barline at their start.  If a measure does not
match the duration of the time signature at the start of the music, it will be
automatically interpreted as a pick-up measure and automatically assigned
a measure number of 0 for use with the `myank` filter.

Here is example music with a pick-up beat, and a typical ending which drops
the duration of the pickup measure:

{% include verovio.html
	humdrum-min-height="275px"
	source="bar3"
	scale="55"
	pageWidth="1400"
%}
<script type="application/x-humdrum" id="bar3">
